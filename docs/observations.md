# Compiled Experiment Observations

We collected more than 72 hours of video onscreen recordings throughout the experiment. Participants were asked to avoid capturing personal information or identifiers. Unfortunately this request was widely ignored. To preserve participant anonymity, **we therefore cannot provide the original video material**.

We can however provide several information, extracted from the video material:

 * Task solving and task preparation times: We measured how much time every participant spent on the actual project conversion tasks and the instructions and provide precise information on their time spendings.
 * Task deviations, difficulties, remarkable observations: We provide for each particiant and each refactoring task a transcript of all noteworthy events. This includes problems with specific task phases, problems with software used, even information on their task solving activity itself.
