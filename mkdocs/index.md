# RESTify Experiment Replication Package

All you need to replicate our findings, in one place.

 > IMPORTANT: THIS IS THE FULLY ANONYMOUS VERSION OF OUR REPLICATION PACKAGE. WE CREATED IT BEFORE WE KNEW ABOUT THE SINGLE BLINDED PRACTICE TRACK. ANONYMIZATION BREAKS SOME FEATURES OF THE REPLICATION PACKAGE. WE WILL SHORTLY SUBSTITUTE THIS PAGE BY THE ORIGINAL VERSION, FOR SINLGE BLINDED REVIEW.

## About

As part of our submission to the [MODELS 2024 conference](https://conf.researchr.org/track/models-2024/models-2024-technical-track#Practice-Track), we offer a replication package that allows fast and independent replication of all our results and interpretations.  
This page serves as starting point for the various components needed.

## Package Content

This section hot-links package content by scope

### Experiment Setup

 * [Recruitment Material](recruitment): A reference to the webpage used for participant recruitment.
 * [MiniMax Heuristic Implementation for Balanced Groups](minimax): Source code and documentation of the algorithm implemented to create a balanced group allocation, that is to say analyze participant self-declared skills and create four comparable groups.
 * [Task Instruction Material](instructions): Collection with instructions for the task instructions. There are four, since the experiment had four groups with diverging task context and order.
 * [Sample Task Applications](applications): The sample applications used task illustration and the conversion task.

### Data Collected and Analyzed

 * [Raw Experiment Collected Data](data): CSV, number/excel and text files that conclude the raw data collected throughout the experiment.
 * [Submission Correctness Evaluation Tool](analyzer): Sources and documentation of the analyzer tool that we implemented to assess correctness of participant submissions. 
 * [Extracted Times and Video Observations](observations): CSV and textual summary files that conclude data extracted from video material viewing, such as transcript of observations and time measurements for the individual conversion tasks.

### Statistical Analysis of Findings

 * [Interactive Jupyter Notebook for Analysis Replication](notebook): Center piece of our replication package. You can recreate all graphics using an interactive notebook that works on the aforementioned raw data and creates the same figures and listings as included in our submission.
