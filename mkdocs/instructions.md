# Task Instructions

Once accepted to the experiment and allocated to a group, every participant received an email with a personal pseudonym and a link to a detailed instruction webpage.  
Some links on the instruction page are broken, due to the anonymization process, as the URL would reveal our identity. This also affects the instruction video screencasts.

Here are anonymized versions of the task instructions pages, for the four groups:

 * [Red Group](https://anonymous4doubleblinded.github.io/InstructionsRed/)
 * [Green Group](https://anonymous4doubleblinded.github.io/InstructionsGreen/)
 * [Blue Group](https://anonymous4doubleblinded.github.io/InstructionsBlue/)
 * [Yellow Group](https://anonymous4doubleblinded.github.io/InstructionsYellow/)

 > Note that the task context and order changes, depending on which group a participant adheres to.
