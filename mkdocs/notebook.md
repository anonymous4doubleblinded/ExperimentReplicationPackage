# Jupyter Notebook to Replicate all Statistics

All statistical figures and listings in our paper submission were created programmatically.

We provide:

 * The raw data
 * The code used for statistical analysis
 * The documentation

Anyone can replicate the correctness of our claims.

We provide several access points, for fast to thorough replication:

 * Static, rendered Jupyter Notebook: You can inspect a static one-shot render of our Notebook [here, on GitHub. You only need a browser.](https://github.com/anonymous4doubleblinded/RestifyJupyter/blob/master/Restify.ipynb)  
Please not that the anonymization process damaged some of the integrated figures. We apologize for the inconvenience.
 * Dynamic, using a docker configuration. See [install instructions for Docker](https://github.com/anonymous4doubleblinded/RestifyJupyter#dockerized-notebook).
 * Dynamic, as a Jupyter Notebook. See [install instructions for native Jupyter](https://github.com/anonymous4doubleblinded/RestifyJupyter#manual-notebook)
 * Dynamic, using the raw python sources. See [install instructions for PyCharm](https://github.com/anonymous4doubleblinded/RestifyJupyter#pycharm-ide)

## Statistics listing
